# FPGA-AUDIO-EQ
 Audio equalization is a fundamental digital signal processing (DSP)  technique used to enhance sound quality by adjusting the amplitude of  different frequency bands. FPGA-based real-time equalizers allow low latency processing, making them suitable for audio enhancement  applications.
